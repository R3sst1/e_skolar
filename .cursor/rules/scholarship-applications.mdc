globs:
alwaysApply: true
---

Use Laravel 10+ with Livewire 3 for all features in this project.
Integrate Icewall by including its CSS and JS files from /public.
Use Icewall’s Tailwind-based classes and JS components for styling and interactions.
Keep all UI consistent with Icewall’s design (sidebar, modals, tables, forms).
Applicants must be able to apply, upload documents, and track their status.
Admins must approve/reject applications with reasons stored in Action History.
SuperAdmin manages users and system configurations.
Use Blade templates with Tailwind CSS utilities matching Icewall style.
Store uploaded documents in storage/app/public/applications and validate with FormRequests.
