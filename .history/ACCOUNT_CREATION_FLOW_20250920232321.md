# Account Creation Flow Implementation

## Overview
This implementation changes the scholarship system flow from self-registration to admin-managed account creation. Applicants first submit their data, and admins create accounts for them.

## New Flow

### 1. Application Submission
- Applicants submit their personal information
- Data is stored in the `residence_data` table
- No user account is created at this stage

### 2. Admin Review
- Admins review applications in the Residence Data management page
- Each applicant shows their status (Pending/Created)
- "Create Account" button appears for applicants without accounts

### 3. Account Creation
- Admin clicks "Create Account" button
- Redirected to Account Management page
- Pre-filled form with applicant's information
- Admin can modify username and password
- Account is created and linked to applicant data

### 4. Applicant Access
- Applicant receives login credentials
- Can access Applicant Dashboard
- Can change password after first login
