### 6. Workflow Logic

**Batch Creation:**
1. Admin selects scholarship program
2. System loads eligible scholars (active scholars with approved applications for that program)
3. Admin searches and selects scholars
4. System calculates total amount based on per-scholar amount
5. Admin can set budget allocation and add remarks
6. Batch is created with `pending` status
7. All selected scholars are linked with `pending` status

**Batch Approval:**
- Budget System can approve/reject entire batches
- Individual scholar status can be updated within approved batches
- Status changes trigger notifications

**Batch Disbursement:**
- Only approved batches can be disbursed
- Disbursement updates batch status to `disbursed`
- All approved scholars in the batch are marked as disbursed
- Budget is deducted from allocated amount

### 7. Security and Validation

**Access Control:**
- Only Admin and SuperAdmin can access disbursement management
- Role-based permissions enforced in Livewire component

**Data Validation:**
- Required scholarship program selection
- Minimum one scholar selection required
- Numeric validation for budget allocation
- String length limits for remarks

**Database Integrity:**
- Foreign key constraints with cascade deletes
- Proper indexing for performance
- Transaction handling for data consistency
